Welcome! I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to document my journey in cybersecurity and software development.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is organized into several sections:

### **Blog Posts**
Technical articles, tutorials, and thoughts on cybersecurity and programming topics. Whether you're interested in penetration testing methodologies, secure coding practices, or the latest security trends, you'll find something here.

### **CTF Writeups**
Detailed writeups of Capture The Flag challenges from platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and others. I break down my methodology, tools used, and lessons learned from each challenge.

### **Projects**
Showcases of personal projects, security tools, and open-source contributions. Each project page includes technical details, source code links, and demonstrations.

## Why I'm Doing This

Documentation is crucial in cybersecurity and development. By writing these posts and writeups, I:

- Solidify my understanding of concepts and techniques
- Create a reference for myself and others
- Contribute to the security community
- Track my learning progress over time

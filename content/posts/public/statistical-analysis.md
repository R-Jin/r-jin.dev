## The statistical Paradigm

- **Infer** the properties of a **population** from a **random sample**.
- Properties of the samples are determined by the underlying properties of the population and **probability**.

## Basic rules of probability

- **Experiment** yields **one** of the possible outcomes
- Set of all possible **outcomes** is the sample space $S$
- An **event** $E \subseteq S$ is a subset of outcomes

  - If the outcome $s$ of the experiment is in the event, $s \in E$, we say the event occurs
  - This is not whole definition. There are also uncountable samples spaces.

- **Probability distribution** $p: $

- **Complement** $E$ of an event $E$

- **Random variable** $X$ maps outcomes to numerical values

- **Expected value** of a random variable $X$ is

  $$
  E[X] = \sum_{s \in S}{X(s)V(s)}
  $$

- **Marginal probability**

## Bayes' theorem

$$
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}
$$
